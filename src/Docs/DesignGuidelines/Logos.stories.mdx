# Logos

This is the full Clariture Hexagon logo and logotype "Clariture Health". The full version of the logo will always have the Clariture Hexagon logo above the logotype as shown here.

Both horizontal and centrally logos are provided. Use whichever format best fits within your design space.

Mono-colored or "line art" elements have also been included to enable you to extend the brand.

## Clear Space

Clear space is the term for a specific amount of space that a logo must have on all sides, no matter where it is used. The reason for clear space is to ensure that a logo maximizes visibility and impact.

### Why clear space matters

Any good designer will tell you that one of the most common mistakes in design is clutter. Cluttered designs distract your audience from everything that the design contains. Especially in the case of a logo, you want your brand to be recognized. Your logo is what connects with customers and it is the #1 item that they will associate with your brand. If your logo is used in cluttered, sloppy and messy ways, your audience will anticipate that your company is also cluttered, sloppy and messy. That's why having an understanding of logo clear space is really beneficial to blank space branding.
