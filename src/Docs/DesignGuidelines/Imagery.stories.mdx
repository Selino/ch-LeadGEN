# Imagery

<br />

### Subject matter

<img src={Imagery} className='float-right m-2' />

Custom and stock images are used to convey messaging but also to reflect the overall mission of the company. Clariture helps healthcare marketing professionals accomplish their goals so the imagery used often reflects that ideal to the viewer. Regardless of gender, ethnicity, or social status Clariture imagery relates to individuals that are thriving within the industry. Photography featuring offices, clinics, and other medically related locations are typically featured

### Treatment

The majority of imagery used in Clariture communication features brightly lighted scenes within medical facilities and offices. The consistent brightness & contrast creates a washed style. Harsh tones and contrasts are avoided.

### Borders & Shadows

When images lack enough contrast to distingish them from a given background subtle borders and drop shadows can be applied.

`border: 1px solid gray-#;`
`box-shadow: 3px 4px 16px grey-#;`
