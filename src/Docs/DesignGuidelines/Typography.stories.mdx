# Typography

Typography is a core aspect of every design system, but also one of the most fragile and overlooked—here’s how we make sure our typography can stand up to change at scale.

<br />

## Fonts for Collateral

Featuring wide apertures on many letters and a large x-height (tall lower-case letters), the typeface is highly legible on screen and at small sizes. It belongs to the humanist genre of sans-serif typefaces, with a true italic. These inherent traits make it a perfect tool for conveying the clean but approachable nature of healthcare marketing crossfunctionally.

> _"Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms."_ - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans#about)

## Fonts for Apps

Building digital products requires a design to solve some specific problems when it comes to displaying text. Having a clear and straight design, there is no doubt that Roboto has become one of the most popular fonts in web design.

- It has a readable shape, in which the white space takes the lead to create a sharp design.

- The elegant contrast of its strokes makes the body text easy to read on data intensive applications.

- Being a comprehensive family font makes it a great choice for web design.

> Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types. - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?selection.family=Roboto#about)
