# Typography

Typography is a core aspect of every design system, but also one of the most fragile and overlooked—here’s how we make sure our typography can stand up to change at scale.

<br />

## Fonts for Collateral

Featuring wide apertures on many letters and a large x-height (tall lower-case letters), the typeface is highly legible on screen and at small sizes. It belongs to the humanist genre of sans-serif typefaces, with a true italic. These inherent traits make it a perfect tool for conveying the clean but approachable nature of healthcare marketing crossfunctionally.

> _"Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms."_ - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans#about)
