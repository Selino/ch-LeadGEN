# Tokens

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

## How to obtain and use tokens within your application

Tokens orginate from a master Figma file and are pulled into applications via the Figma API. At Clariture we use two primary methods for propegating these tokens throughout applications and documents.

### React

The Figma API is accessed via custom React scripts and written to globally available components at `/tokens/` named by type; e.g. colors, fontFamily, etc.

```
// Example YourComponent.js

import colors from "./tokens/colors"
import colors from "./tokens/spacing"
```

### CSS & Tailwind

Use the golablly available components to write any needed custom CSS values, including custom Tailwind settings.

```
// Example YourComponent.js
import colors from "./tokens/colors"
import spacing from "./tokens/spacing"

theme: {
    colors: {
      white: colors.white,
      gray1: colors.graysGray1,
      gray2: colors.graysGray2,
      gray3: colors.graysGray3
    }
    spacing: {
        small: spacing.small,
        medium: spacing.medium,
        large: spacing.large
    }
}
```

## <a id="Colors"></a> Colors

Dynamic colors to use within an application. Tokens that have the prefix of "BRAND" are brandable tokens and are subject to change when a customer applies theming to their org.

## Spacing

Spacing tokens are used for padding, margins, and position coordinates. Border-width tokens are used for the border property.

<DisplaySpacing />

```
// Example YourComponent.js
import spacing from "./tokens/spacing"

return <div style={{width: spacing.large}}>
something here
</div>
```

<br />

## Fonts

Use these font weights to change how thin or heavy the weight is for our font.
