# Tokens

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

## Colors

Generic colors to use within an application. Tokens that have the prefix of "BRAND" are brandable tokens and are subject to change when a customer applies theming to their org.
