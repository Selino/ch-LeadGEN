# Icons

An icon is a small graphical representation of a program, feature, or file. When you click or double-click an icon, the associated file or program opens or an action is performed. For example, if you were to double-click My Computer icon, it would open Windows Explorer. Icons are a component of GUI operating systems, including Apple macOS X and Microsoft Windows. Icons help users quickly identify the type of file represented by the icon. The image is an example of "My Computer" icons in different versions of Microsoft Windows.
