## Brand Guidelines

Design guidelines are sets of recommendations on how to apply design principles to provide a positive user experience. Designers, engineers, and other stakeholders use these guidelines to judge how to adopt principles such as intuitiveness, learnability, efficiency and consistency so they can create compelling designs and meet and exceed user needs.

Design should be simple to understand and easy to use. It should gude users to achieve goals via intuitive interfaces. Visuals should create meaning, all elements should have reason.

Each of these packages offers powerful and proven features that are opt-in on every level. üëçüèæ
