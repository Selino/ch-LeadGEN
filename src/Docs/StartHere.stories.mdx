# Introduction

> **Design System**
> : a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications

These docs serve as the single source of truth for designers, developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to help them craft beautiful, consistent, user-friendly product experiences within the Clariture family of applications.

## Brand Guidelines

Design guidelines are sets of recommendations on how to apply design principles to provide a positive user experience. Designers, engineers, and other stakeholders use these guidelines to judge how to adopt principles such as intuitiveness, learnability, efficiency and consistency so they can create compelling designs and meet and exceed user needs.

Design should be simple to understand and easy to use. It should gude users to achieve goals via intuitive interfaces. Visuals should create meaning, all elements should have reason.

## Platform

The Clariture Design System is built on top of [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/), and we use [React v17](https://reactjs.org) as a base Javascript code library. Each of these packages offers powerful and proven features that are opt-in on every level. üëçüèæ
