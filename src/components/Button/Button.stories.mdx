# Usage Guidelines

In this section, we will look at the hierarchy of buttons and the language that they communicate. Button actions are not determined by how they look (although users should be able to learn what the buttons mean by their styling), but rather by how they are used.

## Call to action (CTA / C2A)

A call to action button, depending on the situation, will usually prompt users to sign up/register/buy now/etc. CTA buttons should be used where the platform wants to strongly suggest something that the user should do.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name='Call to Action'
    args={{
      variant: "success",
      text: "Sign Up Now!",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Primary action

While a CTA button and a primary button can look the same, I like to separate them out. While CTA buttons are what the interface would want you to do, primary buttons should be a strong visual indicator to help the user to complete their journey. Primary buttons should be used in situations where the user may want to go ‘next’, ‘complete’, ‘start’, etc.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name='Primary Action'
    args={{
      variant: "primary",
      text: "Next",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Secondary action

Secondary buttons are the ‘go back’ to the primary button’s ‘next’, or the ‘cancel’ button to the ‘submit’ button. Secondary buttons are the alternative we give users to the primary action.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name='Secondary Action'
    args={{
      variant: "outline-secondary",
      text: "Back",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name='Primary Action 2'
    args={{
      variant: "primary",
      text: "Next",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

export const Template = (args) => <Button {...args}>{args.text}</Button>
