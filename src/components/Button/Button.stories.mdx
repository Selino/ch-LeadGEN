# Buttons

Buttons are used to create a new action or continue a step in a process. Uses might include:

Delineate the next step in a process
Begin a new task
Initiate a new element on the screen
Submit a form
Button color is important, but alone is not enough to clearly communicate the meaning of the button. Be sure to include text on your button that along with the color choice conveys the meaning of your button.

### Call to action (CTA / C2A)

A call to action button, depending on the situation, will usually prompt users to sign up/register/buy now/etc. CTA buttons should be used where the platform wants to strongly suggest something that the user should do.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name='Call to Action'
    args={{
      variant: "success",
      text: "Sign Up Now!",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Primary action

While a CTA button and a primary button can look the same, I like to separate them out. While CTA buttons are what the interface would want you to do, primary buttons should be a strong visual indicator to help the user to complete their journey. Primary buttons should be used in situations where the user may want to go ‘next’, ‘complete’, ‘start’, etc.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name='Primary Action'
    args={{
      variant: "primary",
      text: "Next",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Secondary action

Secondary buttons are the ‘go back’ to the primary button’s ‘next’, or the ‘cancel’ button to the ‘submit’ button. Secondary buttons are the alternative we give users to the primary action.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name='Secondary Action'
    args={{
      variant: "outline-secondary",
      text: "Back",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name='Primary Action 2'
    args={{
      variant: "primary",
      text: "Next",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Text link

Text links are a very simple button type. There are a couple of different ways to show that something is a link. This could be with a colour, or an underline, or the position of the link, or even just the text itself (e.g. “Read more”).

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name='Text Link'
    args={{
      variant: null,
      text: "Back",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

export const Template = (args) => <Button {...args}>{args.text}</Button>
